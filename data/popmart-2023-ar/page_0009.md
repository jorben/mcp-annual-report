# CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
董事長致辭

Dear Shareholders and Investors:
尊敬的各位股東及投資人朋友：

As time flies by, Pop Mart has spent its third complete financial year after listing. Looking back on the past year, Pop Mart’s revenue and net profit hit a record high. Pop Mart achieved an annual revenue of RMB6.3 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 36.5%; adjusted net profit was RMB1.19 billion, with a year-on-year increase of 107.6%.
三年一個小周期，一轉眼，泡泡瑪特已經度過了上市後第三個完整的財年。回顧過去一年，泡泡瑪特營收、淨利潤均創歷史新高。泡泡瑪特全年實現營收63億人民幣，同比增長36.5%；調整後淨利潤11.9億元，同比增長107.6%。

The overall IP performance of Pop Mart was excellent last year, with 10 IPs exceeding RMB100 million in sales for the first time. The revenue of SKULLPANDA and MOLLY, the top IPs, exceeded RMB1 billion, and their sales both accounted for approximately 16% of the total. The top five IPs in terms of sales accounted for around 55% of the total, and the sales share of IPs was both concentrated and dispersed, which was in a very sound position. These sales figures proved the attractiveness of our IPs and our more mature capability on IP operation accumulated over the years.
去年泡泡瑪特IP整體表現優異，第一次有10個IP銷售額過億。頭部IP SKULLPANDA、MOLLY收入均突破10億人民幣，銷售佔比都在16%左右。銷售排名前五的IP合計佔比在55%左右，IP銷售佔比既有集中也有分散，是一個非常健康的狀態，這些銷售數據證明了我們IP的吸引力，以及我們多年積累下來的更加成熟的IP運營能力。

Deepening the DTC strategy is the core approach to globalize Pop Mart in recent years. By expanding our brand through retail stores, online channels, and hosting industry conventions, the recognition of Pop Mart’s brand and its IP has further increased globally. In 2023, we opened our first offline stores in France, Malaysia, Thailand and Netherlands, and set a new global store record for sales on the first day.
深化DTC戰略是近年來泡泡瑪特全球化的核心思路，通過布局品牌線下門店、線上渠道，及舉辦行業展會，泡泡瑪特品牌及旗下IP在全球認可度進一步提升。2023年，泡泡瑪特線下門店首次進駐法國、馬來西亞、泰國、荷蘭，全球門店首日銷售額紀錄數次刷新。

We had always stood firm on regarding IP as our core asset at the time of listing, with globalisation and conglomeration as our core development strategies. In recent years, despite the complex and ever-changing economic and social environment, we have consistently implemented these two major strategies to steadily advance our business and achieve revenue growth and sustainable profitability, which has demonstrated strong organisational resilience. The year of 2023 has witnessed initial success of Pop Mart’s strategies since its listing, with seeds sown in the past having borne abundant fruits: POP LAND has landed in Chaoyang Park in Beijing, becoming the first immersive IP-themed park in the pop toy industry; the gaming business is announced to be launched soon; the Company’s contemporary art operation institution, inner flow, has opened a Gallery in Beijing 798 Art Park; and the animation business is also in proactive preparation.
泡泡瑪特上市的時候就對外表示，IP是我們的核心，全球化和集團化是我們的核心發展戰略。近幾年，儘管經濟、社會環境複雜多變，我們始終堅定不移地執行兩大戰略，保持業務穩步推進，實現營收增長並持續盈利，體現了強大的組織韌性。2023年是泡泡瑪特上市以來，戰略成果初見成效的一年，過去埋下的一些種子結出了豐碩果實：泡泡瑪特城市樂園落地北京朝陽公園，成為潮玩行業首個沉浸式IP主題樂園；遊戲業務宣佈即將上線；旗下青年當代藝術運營機構inner flow在北京798藝術區落地inner flow Gallery；動畫業務也在積極籌備中。
