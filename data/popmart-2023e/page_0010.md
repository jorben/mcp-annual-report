# CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
董事長致辭

As the process of globalisation and conglomeration continues to deepen, “Pop Toy” no longer fully explains the essence of Pop Mart. In 2023, we re-identified and restructured the Company’s future business development into four core segments: IP incubation and operation, pop toy merchandizing and retail, theme park and IP experience, and digital entertainment. Among which, the theme park and IP experience. The theme park and IP experience business includes park operations, domestic and overseas pop toy shows, and internally-incubated new businesses. Meanwhile, the digital entertainment business focuses on game development, content creation, and related activities.

隨著全球化和集團化穩步推進，「潮玩」兩個字已不足以定義泡泡瑪特。2023年，我們重新梳理了本公司未來的業務版塊，把本公司業務分成了IP孵化與運營、潮流玩具與零售、主題樂園與體驗、數字娛樂四大版塊。其中主題樂園與體驗業務包含樂園業務、國內和海外的潮玩展業務，以及內部孵化的一些新業務；數字娛樂更多是基於未來，包含了我們的遊戲、內容等相關的業務。

In 2023, Pop Mart has achieved excellent results. However, we are much more concerned about the Company’s determination to execute its strategy and the new capabilities it has developed as well as its enhanced steadiness as a whole, not just financial figures. The Company is becoming more and more mature, while the sound development of many new businesses has created expectations for the future. Thus, we are very confident in the future development of the Company.

2023年，泡泡瑪特取得了非常不錯的成績，但我們更關心數字背後，本公司對戰略的執行定力，長出的新能力，以及整個公司健康度的提升。本公司在變得越來越成熟，很多新業務的健康發展給未來埋下了值得期待的種子。我們對本公司未來的發展非常有信心。

Finally, I would like to extend my gratitude to all consumers, partners and investors for your long-time support and trust, and to all colleagues for your hard work. I hope we can continue to work together and forge ahead towards our vision of becoming the world’s leading pop culture entertainment company.

最後，要感謝所有消費者、合作夥伴、投資人一如既往的支持與信任，感謝所有同事的辛勤工作。希望我們繼續攜手奮進、砥礪前行，為實現全球領先的潮流文化娛樂公司這一使命全力以赴。
